[Fake-Store-API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs)

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/1486577-f171c6e2-10ab-4349-bc10-9db4449da719?action=collection%2Ffork&collection-url=entityId%3D1486577-f171c6e2-10ab-4349-bc10-9db4449da719%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3D18e6f11c-8e45-4bea-b35a-8f6ad5fa2c29)

Please try to go through the project files before you proceed to the user stories.

### User stories

Below are a list of user stories for our E-commerce app. Each user story has associated acceptance criteria/s.
A user story is said **[Completed]** when all acceptance criteria's for the user story are completed and tested.

**STR-US1** has been implemented for you.

#### STR-US1. As a user, I would like to view all products in the online store [Completed]

Acceptance criteria:

1. As a user I should be able to view all the products on the dashboard.
2. Each product should have a title, image and price.
3. When a user clicks on the product image, it opens a modal with product details.
4. When I click on `Add to bag`, a notification with the name of the product is shown on `top-end` position.

#### STR-US2. As a user, I would like to view only 8 products on a page

Acceptance criteria:

1. As a user I should be able to view only 8 products per page on the dashboard.
2. The product results should be paginated and there should be a next and previous button at the bottom of the product list to
   navigate to next page and show next 8 products.

**Note: Please use the api to limit the results per page [here](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) Products > Limit Result**

#### STR-US3. As a user, when I click on a product on the dashboard, it should me the details of the product

Acceptance criteria:

1. A user clicks on a product image on the dashboard.
2. The user is navigated to the products page where the product image, title, descritpion, category and price are shown.
3. A button `Add to cart` is shown below the product details.
4. When the user clicks on the `Add to cart` button, the product is added to the user's cart. _(This functionality can be either mocked or you can implement this via React Context API)_

**Option 1: Mock the functionality [Complexity: Easy]**

- Make an api call to fake-store-api to add new product to the cart as shown [here](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#c-new).
- Store the response and either show it as a modal or an alert (you can use React-Bootstrap [Modal](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/) or [Alert](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/) components).
- On clicking back, the user should be navigated back to dashboard.

**Option 2: Use Context API [Complexity: Hard]**

- Create a Context named - CartContext.
- CartContext should store array of Products.
- When a user adds product to cart, the product including its details should be added to the context.
- These details should persist when the user is navigated back to the dashboard
- [BONUS]: In the Navbar, you can display the total number of products in the cart.

---

#### STR-US4. As a user, I would like to sort products on dashboard in either accending or descending order

Acceptance criteria:

1. Add a dropdown, with options to Sort - ASC, Sort-DESC.
2. The dropdown should be added below the navbar and floated to right. You can use `flex justify-content-end` class or `float:right`.
3. When the user chooses `SORT-ASC` the products should be sorted by their price in ascending order. When user chooses `SORT-DESC` the products on dashboard should be sorted according to their prices in descending order.

#### STR-US5. As a user, I should be able to login to view my cart

Acceptance criteria:

1. As a user, I would like to login with given username and password. This username and password can be found in the postman collection.
2. When the user enters username and password, and the login is successfull, the user is navigated to `/my-cart`
3. When the user enters incorrect username and password and the login is un-sucesscessfull, a errpr message is shown below the username and password. You can specify your own error messages.
4. When user is navigated to `/my-cart` page, only items in cart number 5 are shown. You can refer to the api call [here](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs) Cart> Get a single.
5. You can map the product id's in the cart with list of all products to show which items are in the user's cart.
